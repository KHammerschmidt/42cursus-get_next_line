## üí° About the project
> Write a project with maximum of 10 functions under the 42 norminette restrictions, that reads one line from a file descriptor with varying BUFFER_SIZE. Thereby, only one line should be returned and any remains after the newline should be saved for a repetitive function call.
</br>

**Requirements** </br>
- Repeated calls (e.g., using a loop) to get_next_line() function should read the text file pointed to by the file descriptor, one line at a time.</br>
- The function should return the line that was read. If there is nothing else to read or if an error occurred, it should return NULL.</br>
- Function should work as expected both when reading a file and when reading from the standard input.</br>
- The returned line should include the terminating \n character, except if the end of file was reached and does not end with a \n character.</br>
- lseek() is forbidden.</br>
- Global variables are forbidden.</br>
</br>

**Key learning points**
  - Learning about file descriptors and reading from a file
  - Using static variables
</br>

## üõ†Ô∏è **Usage**

clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/KHammerschmidt/42cursus-get_next_line &&
cd 42cursus-get_next_line &&
git clone https://github.com/KHammerschmidt/42cursus-Libft
```

to modify the buffer size used by read() adapt BUFFERSIZE value n in </br>
[`Makefile`](./Makefile) ``` CPPFLAGS	:= -D BUFFER_SIZE=n ```

to compile the project:
```bash
make
```
</br>
