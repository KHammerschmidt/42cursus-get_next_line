## üí° About the project
> Write a project with maximum of 10 functions under the 42 norminette restrictions, that reads one line from a file descriptor with varying BUFFER_SIZE. Thereby, only one line should be returned and any remains after the newline should be saved for a repetitive function call.
</br>

**Requirements** </br>
‚Ä¢ Repeated calls (e.g., using a loop) to your get_next_line() function should let you read the text file pointed to by the file descriptor, one line at a time.
‚Ä¢ Your function should return the line that was read. If there is nothing else to read or if an error occurred, it should return NULL.
‚Ä¢ Make sure that your function works as expected both when reading a file and when reading from the standard input.
‚Ä¢ Please note that the returned line should include the terminating \n character, except if the end of file was reached and does not end with a \n character.
‚Ä¢ lseek() is forbidden.
‚Ä¢ Global variables are forbidden.

‚Ä¢ You will compile your code as follows (a buffer size of 42 is used as an example): cc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -D BUFFER_SIZE=42 <files>.c
‚Ä¢ We consider that get_next_line() has an undefined behavior if the file pointed to by the file descriptor changed since the last call whereas read() didn‚Äôt reach the end of file.
‚Ä¢ We also consider that get_next_line() has an undefined behavior when reading a binary file. However, you can implement a logical way to handle this behavior if you want to.

‚Ä¢ Because you will have to read files in get_next_line(), add this option to your compiler call: -D BUFFER_SIZE=n
It will define the buffer size for read().
The buffer size value will be modified by your peer-evaluators and the Moulinette in order to test your code.

**Key learning points**
  - Learning about file descriptors and reading from a file
  - Using static variables
</br>

## üõ†Ô∏è **Usage**
To compile the project use the command ``` make ``` <br/>
To change the BUFFER_SIZE of read() adapt the BUFFER_SIZE value n in [`Makefile`](./Makefile)
``` CPPFLAGS		:=		-D BUFFER_SIZE=n ```
Project Libft with standard library functions required in root.
